# Virtual-Cursor
This project implements a virtual mouse/cursor controlled by hand gestures using computer vision techniques. It uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to detect and track hand movements, enabling the user to control the mouse pointer, perform clicks, and interact with their computer â€” touchless!
